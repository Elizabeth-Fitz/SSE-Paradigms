# About The Project

Here's a blank template for your group to use.

## Built With
List here all the dependencies of your project (including version). For example:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)



## Getting Started

Follow the instructions shown (you should start by registering unless you previously registered)

## Problems
Every feature is not fully functional and not fully implemented on the backend. We also had trouble reading the files, so it uses English words only.
